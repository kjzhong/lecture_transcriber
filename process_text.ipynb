that's better because it gives us an overall distance to see of one plus three plus to which is that we going okay ducks just up with them is complete because we have a spanning tree.so that the next step we i'm i've just added in the vertex age so it's going to give us some new options we bring down and edges that we can carry down from above but we don't carry done h because we just used it i'm yes it's still find duties fine.it's not contributing any more options because we can't use the edge bt so we just have one choice at this stage which is hi i'm going to grab the edge h i o distance five it gives a distance of five from eyes on so the news that checks that we.add is a with distance five and i'm let's put that in age of five see it right so that's just one that it gives a distance one plus three plus one overall from eye to eye that was the second lost that on.so here's an example just to finish up with to illustrate that point is a very simple graph i'm g which has five that a sees a b c d a and it has whites on the edges and we claim that tehran one is a minimal spanning tree you can see it he a it's a puff.okay whereas t to withhold is a minimal a pop spanning tree and j so it gives minimal distances from the special the checks i and it has white a focus two plus two plus one which is nine so we can see that teacher is definite.he carried down the edges i'm that you can we're not going to carry done enough of this lady cause we just use this and let's see anything else follow i know everything else his face and from the news attacks f we have a look at what other options that opens up for us so.and we also have the edges you can get to from a and those a a baby with i'm noticed the number and it's is to this is because the distance that you would have from the takes eight along that path is well from a to eat is one.similarly from a to je the number in brackets for that it just three because it's one to get to a that's this number of here by the way and then the whites of the edge de g is an additional two so overall it gives you a g gives you a distance of three from.added thing into the tree team so the edge a be if we added it it would close up of circuit it's not one of the edges we consider any more because both of the vet a sees a and be a already in the tree that age would make a second so we don't consider any more so you have to just check when you're copying it just down from the law.and why would it be it's on three different question it does give minimal distances from i. whereas t one which is minimal it doesn't use minimal to from i for example t to what's the distance that be is that from a well it's one plus two so that three be is that distance three from i intend to whereas over here in t one if.i'm from a to see which has a distance of seven and we want to minimize i'm at each step so we going to choose from a t which gives us the new i'm next verse hex to add in which is he it gives us a distance one from eighth i okay.the possible edges that we have to choose from when you look at this list i just see comes down a child is the one we just added f c is still a possibility and s i is no longer on the menu because it's between to the disease that we've already got so of these two options the best one.the point is that the algorithms answering three different questions and so you can't expect dykstra algorithm to produce a minimum spanning tree it's producing i'm minimal distances from a it's answering a different question.it's clearly i'm f c which gives a distance of six to the final that checks see so from agency is like this and that is not the one we just added i'm so sorry.the de um is a new one it's an edge from be outside and it ends up giving a possible distance of eight from a if we added in the edge of white six the pass from a would be to plus six which is i that's why this is an eye.step when we look at edges that go from something in the tree to something outside of the tree the only possibilities are the three i'm edges that an incident with i so from a to be which has a distance of to or waste of to from eighty which has a distance of one.so this is i'm the completed spanning tree all typed up and we can see that let's have a look at the soviet yeah these are the distances i is it there are from itself that these of the distance is that the tree gives from a to each of the vertices.now we want to make a greedy choice and so at this stage we only have one option which is ekg which gives a distance three from the neither checks i'm g i because egypt so had a white of to and so the pass is a distance.so it's a spanning tree okay and we call it a minimal v not pop spanning tree but it doesn't mean that it's and minimum spanning tree it just means it's the one that gives you the shortest paths from being not to everywhere else.so we see i'm that these two algorithms are answering different questions and you can't expect the output of dykstra algorithm to be a minimum spanning tree and that's it on those outtwo plus two plus two said it's time we only get three edges of white to not oh no sorry i beg your pardon we do get full a let's sick of them one plus one two plus two plus two plus two right and plus three plus.i keep going same sort of thing so we carry down i'm the edges that a safe to carry down such as i see still find baby's still find any gene we just use so we don't take that again.i'm from a to be is one and so overall from a to be it would give you a distance of two so that's why this number here is too.and that's because the edge a i'm itself had a wife of one and there was no early a pod of the past from i the whole toss is just this one edge so now he is in the tree okay.\n"
